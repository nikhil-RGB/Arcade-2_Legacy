<br>
-A legacy project-The first GUI version of Arcade.<br> 
-I worked on this in 11th grade, and can't find the source code for the project, which is why it isn't open source.<br>
-The introduction video I recorded for this  application was recorded with a phone camera, and has pretty bad audio quality, so please     don't judge. My GUI building skills were pretty bad back then, so this project should not be considered the norm for the quality of my work or skills, it's been uploaded only to satisfy my nostalgia.
